# us-population-heatwave-italy-quick-visualization

This is a quick **data visualization** project done in my first year of my Masterâ€™s program.
The objectives were : 
- Retrieve census and meteorological data via APIs.
- Visualize the data using **R** and **Python** tools.

It was divided into two parts : 
- NHGIS and the US county population
  R-based visualization using packages such as **Leaflet** and **Shiny**
- Heatwave summer 2022 Italy
  Python-based visualisation using librairies like **matplotlib** , **Cartopy** and **xarray**

Both a rendered in R-Markdown HTML
